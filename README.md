# C-CRUD-API
Simple CRUD API


First, create a new ASP.NET Core project in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.

Next, create a new class called "TodoItem.cs" in your project.

This class represents a Todo item with an id, name, completion status, and created date.

Next, create a new folder called "Controllers" in your project and add a new class called "TodoItemsController.cs". 

This class represents a controller that handles CRUD operations for Todo items. It has methods for getting all items, getting an item by id, creating a new item, updating an existing item, and deleting an item.

Finally, start your API and test the endpoints using an HTTP client such as Postman or curl.
